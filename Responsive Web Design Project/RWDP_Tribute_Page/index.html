        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba
          clan in the village of Mvezo, in the Eastern Cape, on 18 July 1918.
          His mother was Nonqaphi Nosekeni and his father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa
          Gadla Mandela, principal counsellor to the Acting King of the Thembu
          people, Jongintaba Dalindyebo. In 1930, when he was 12 years old, his
          father died and the young Rolihlahla became a ward of Jongintaba at
          the Great Place in Mqhekezweni1.
        </p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hearing the elders’ stories of his ancestors’
          valour during the wars of resistance, he dreamed also of making his
          own contribution to the freedom struggle of his people. Louise3 He
          attended primary school in Qunu where his teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave
          him the name Nelson, in accordance with the custom of giving all
          schoolchildren “Christian” names. He completed his Junior Certificate
          at Clarkebury Boarding Institute and went on to Healdtown, a Wesleyan
          secondary school of some repute, where he matriculated. Mandela began
          his studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University College of
          Fort Hare but did not complete the degree there as he was expelled for
          joining in a student protest.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On his return to the Great Place at
          Mqhekezweni the King was furious and said if he didn’t return to Fort
          Hare he would arrange wives for him and his cousin Justice. They ran
          away to Johannesburg instead, arriving there in 1941. There he worked
          as a mine security officer and after meeting Walter Sisulu, an estate
          agent, he was introduced to Lazer Sidelsky. He then did his articles
          through a firm of attorneys – Witkin, Eidelman and Sidelsky. He
          completed his BA through the University of South Africa and went back
          to Fort Hare for his graduation in 1943. Meanwhile, he began studying
          for an LLB at the University of the Witwatersrand. By his own
          admission he was a poor student and left the university in 1952
          without graduating. He only started studying again through the
          University of London after his imprisonment in 1962 but also did not
          complete that degree. In 1989, while in the last months of his
          imprisonment, he obtained an LLB through the University of South
          Africa. He graduated in absentia at a ceremony in Cape Town.
        </p>
        <h3>Political Career</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mandela, while increasingly politically
          involved from 1942, only joined the African National Congress in 1944
          when he helped to form the ANC Youth League (ANCYL). In 1944 he
          married Walter Sisulu’s cousin, Evelyn Mase, a nurse. They had two
          sons, Madiba Thembekile "Thembi" and Makgatho, and two daughters both
          called Makaziwe, the first of whom died in infancy. He and his wife
          divorced in 1958. Mandela rose through the ranks of the ANCYL and
          through its efforts, the ANC adopted a more radical mass-based policy,
          the Programme of Action, in 1949.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In 1952 he was chosen as the National
          Volunteer-in-Chief of the Defiance Campaign with Maulvi Cachalia as
          his deputy. This campaign of civil disobedience against six unjust
          laws was a joint programme between the ANC and the South African
          Indian Congress. He and 19 others were charged under the Suppression
          of Communism Act for their part in the campaign and sentenced to nine
          months of hard labour, suspended for two years. A two-year diploma in
          law on top of his BA allowed Mandela to practise law, and in August
          1952 he and Oliver Tambo established South Africa’s first black law
          firm, Mandela & Tambo. At the end of 1952 he was banned for the first
          time. As a restricted person he was only permitted to watch in secret
          as the Freedom Charter was adopted in Kliptown on 26 June 1955.
        </p>
        <h3>Arrest and Trial</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mandela was arrested in a countrywide police
          swoop on 5 December 1956, which led to the 1956 Treason Trial. Men and
          women of all races found themselves in the dock in the marathon trial
          that only ended when the last 28 accused, including Mandela, were
          acquitted on 29 March 1961. On 21 March 1960 police killed 69 unarmed
          people in a protest in Sharpeville against the pass laws. This led to
          the country’s first state of emergency and the banning of the ANC and
          the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) on 8 April. Mandela and his
          colleagues in the Treason Trial were among thousands detained during
          the state of emergency. During the trial Mandela married a social
          worker, Winnie Madikizela, on 14 June 1958. They had two daughters,
          Zenani and Zindziswa. The couple divorced in 1996.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Days before the end of the Treason Trial,
          Mandela travelled to Pietermaritzburg to speak at the All-in Africa
          Conference, which resolved that he should write to Prime Minister
          Verwoerd requesting a national convention on a non-racial
          constitution, and to warn that should he not agree there would be a
          national strike against South Africa becoming a republic. After he and
          his colleagues were acquitted in the Treason Trial, Mandela went
          underground and began planning a national strike for 29, 30 and 31
          March. In the face of massive mobilisation of state security the
          strike was called off early. In June 1961 he was asked to lead the
          armed struggle and helped to establish Umkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the
          Nation), which launched on 16 December 1961 with a series of
          explosions. On 11 January 1962, using the adopted name David
          Motsamayi, Mandela secretly left South Africa. He travelled around
          Africa and visited England to gain support for the armed struggle. He
          received military training in Morocco and Ethiopia and returned to
          South Africa in July 1962. He was arrested in a police roadblock
          outside Howick on 5 August while returning from KwaZulu-Natal, where
          he had briefed ANC President Chief Albert Luthuli about his trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He was charged with leaving the country
          without a permit and inciting workers to strike. He was convicted and
          sentenced to five years' imprisonment, which he began serving at the
          Pretoria Local Prison. On 27 May 1963 he was transferred to Robben
          Island and returned to Pretoria on 12 June. Within a month police
          raided Liliesleaf, a secret hideout in Rivonia, Johannesburg, used by
          ANC and Communist Party activists, and several of his comrades were
          arrested. On 9 October 1963 Mandela joined 10 others on trial for
          sabotage in what became known as the Rivonia Trial. While facing the
          death penalty his words to the court at the end of his famous "Speech
          from the Dock" on 20 April 1964 became immortalised
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On 11 June 1964 Mandela and seven other
          accused, Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada, Govan Mbeki, Raymond Mhlaba,
          Denis Goldberg, Elias Motsoaledi and Andrew Mlangeni, were convicted
          and the next day were sentenced to life imprisonment. Goldberg was
          sent to Pretoria Prison because he was white, while the others went to
          Robben Island. Mandela’s mother died in 1968 and his eldest son,
          Thembi, in 1969. He was not allowed to attend their funerals. On 31
          March 1982 Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town
          with Sisulu, Mhlaba and Mlangeni. Kathrada joined them in October.
          When he returned to the prison in November 1985 after prostate
          surgery, Mandela was held alone. Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee
          visited him in hospital. Later Mandela initiated talks about an
          ultimate meeting between the apartheid government and the ANC.
        </p>
        <h3>Release from Prison</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On 12 August 1988 he was taken to hospital
          where he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. After more than three months
          in two hospitals he was transferred on 7 December 1988 to a house at
          Victor Verster Prison near Paarl where he spent his last 14 months of
          imprisonment. He was released from its gates on Sunday 11 February
          1990, nine days after the unbanning of the ANC and the PAC and nearly
          four months after the release of his remaining Rivonia comrades.
          Throughout his imprisonment he had rejected at least three conditional
          offers of release. Mandela immersed himself in official talks to end
          white minority rule and in 1991 was elected ANC President to replace
          his ailing friend, Oliver Tambo. In 1993 he and President FW de Klerk
          jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize and on 27 April 1994 he voted for
          the first time in his life.
        </p>
        <h3>President of South Africa</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On 10 May 1994 he was inaugurated as South
          Africa’s first democratically elected President. On his 80th birthday
          in 1998 he married Graça Machel, his third wife. True to his promise,
          Mandela stepped down in 1999 after one term as President. He continued
          to work with the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund he set up in 1995 and
          established the Nelson Mandela Foundation and The Mandela Rhodes
          Foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In April 2007 his grandson, Mandla Mandela,
          was installed as head of the Mvezo Traditional Council at a ceremony
          at the Mvezo Great Place. Nelson Mandela never wavered in his devotion
          to democracy, equality and learning. Despite terrible provocation, he
          never answered racism with racism. His life is an inspiration to all
          who are oppressed and deprived; and to all who are opposed to
          oppression and deprivation. He died at his home in Johannesburg on 5
          December 2013.
